Description: The s-CorrPlot is a scatterplot for visually exploring pairwise
    correlation coefficients between variables in large datasets. Variables are
    projected as points on a scatterplot with respect to some user-selected
    variables of interest, driven by a geometric interpretation of correlation.
    The correlation of all other variables to the selected one is indicated by
    vertical gridlines in the plot. By selecting new variables of interest, a
    user can create simple tours of the correlation space through animations
    between different projections of the data.
