The most common techniques for visualizing correlation, like scatterplot matrices and clustered heatmaps, however, do not scale well to large datasets, either computationally or visually. We present a new visualization that is capable of encoding pairwise correlation between hundreds of thousands variables, called the **s-CorrPlot**. The **s-CorrPlot** is based on a 2D scatterplot and exploits the geometric structure underlying Pearsonâ€™s correlation to derive a novel spatial encoding. The **s-CorrPlot** not only depicts a visually precise measure of correlation, but also supports visualizing metadata using encoding channels like color. We implemented the **s-CorrPlot** as an open-source proof of concept visualization in order to validate its effectiveness through a variety of methods including a case study with a biology collaborator.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proof of concept employs simple multidimensional exploration techniques, to demonstrate how this visual encoding can employ the vast set of these exploration techniques for exploring correlation.\r\n\r\nFor further details, please read the description and derivation of the **s-CorrPlot** in our paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode Dependencies\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe **s-CorrPlot** has been implemented within a proof of concept prototype: *Gyroscope*. The proof of concept is integrated within the R statistical framework for data input and output. The *Gyroscope* code is written in C++ and OpenGL.\r\n\r\nThe source code has been compiled and tested on both Mac OS X and Linux.\r\n\r\nTo compile *Gyroscope* through R, the following components must be installed:\r\n\r\n-  **R** ([version 2.10 or newer](http://www.r-project.org/))\r\n-  **Xcode** (for *Mac*, [install Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [download command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/))\r\n-  **Fortran compiler** (for *Mac*, [update your version](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/))\r\n-  **OpenGL** (for *Linux*, OpenGL library [like freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nBe sure to install all dependencies, as detailed above.\r\n\r\nThen, simply run the install script as root:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./install\r\n\r\nIf it prints out \"Done\", then *Gyroscope* has installed correctly inside R, as the library *\"gyroscope\"*.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisualizing Correlation\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nTo explore correlation, you can load the data from the paper in our proof of concept visualization.\r\nSample scripts load the data in R, and the data is provided in R format so that you can input your own data, too.\r\n\r\nEach script loads a different dataset, corresponding to figures from the paper. The variables being correlated are listed first in the description:\r\n\r\n-  **genes**.R\r\n   -  genes in two brain regions, *Figure 9*\r\n-  **geneDensity**.R\r\n   -  genes in several regions, *Figures 5 & 6*\r\n-  **imagePatches**.R\r\n   -  subset of image patches of a full image, *Figure 1(c)*\r\n-  **imagePatches-full**.R\r\n   -  complete image patches for two image datasets, *Figure 7(b)*\r\n-  **subway-stops**.R\r\n   -  stations of subway ridership, *Figure 8(b)*\r\n-  **subway-time**.R\r\n   -  years of subway ridership, *Figure 8(a)*\r\n\r\nCertain datasets have been anonymized in order to protect our biology collaborator's sensitive data.\r\n\r\nThese scripts can be run from terminal or loaded in R:\r\n\r\n    ./genes.R\r\n\r\n*or*\r\n\r\n    R\r\n    source(\"genes.R\")\r\n\r\nPlease note that these scripts cannot be run from the R GUI program; they must be executed from the terminal.\r\n\r\nFor further instructions on how to use *Gyroscope*, please read the detailed help file in R:\r\n\r\n    R\r\n    library(gyroscope)\r\n    ?gyroscope\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUninstallation\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nRun the uninstall script as root or start R to remove the *Gyroscope* package:\r\n\r\n    sudo ./uninstall\r\n\r\n*or*\r\n\r\n    R\r\n    remove.packages(\"gyroscope\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis project's codebase *(Gyroscope)* is licensed by GPLv2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n-------\r\n\r\n[Sean McKenna](http://www.seanpmckenna.com/), [Miriah Meyer](http://www.cs.utah.edu/~miriah/), [Christopher Gregg](http://www.neuro.utah.edu/people/faculty/gregg.html), & [Samuel Gerber](http://www.math.duke.edu/~sgerber/)\r\n\r\nThe *Gyroscope* code was originally designed and developed by [Samuel Gerber](http://www.math.duke.edu/~sgerber/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nIf you have any difficulties or questions, please contact <sean@cs.utah.edu>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
